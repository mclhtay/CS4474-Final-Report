## Installation

*DO NOT upgrade the Idyll version! @Latest versions are alpha versions and are faulty!*

- Make sure you have `idyll` installed (`npm i -g idyll`).
- Clone this repo and run `npm install --force`.
  - We use `--force` to force install Functional Component based React libraries.

## Development
- Run `npm run start` to develop with the local server running

## Deployment

*<b>NEVER</b> run `idyll build`! The built-in build script is several version behind npm*

- Make sure you delete the `build/` folder first as it may contain ill-formatted data
- Run `npm run start`
  - Warnings and errors generated by this step that do not affect the local website you see can be ignored
- Stop the server
- Run `gh-pages -d build`
